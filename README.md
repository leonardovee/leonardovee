### Hi, I'm Leonardo 🤙🏻

A Software Engineer based in Florianópolis.
I'm a computer science enthusiast, also I work with software engineering.

I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer at iFood, where I write some software to make the life of people easier.

Here you can find some of my experimental applications along with cool stuff that I've found on GitHub.
