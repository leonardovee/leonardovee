### Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm Leonardo Vieira, a software engineer from Brazil that is passionate about architecture, manga, and programming languages. 

I currently work as a Software Engineer at PicPay, where I write some software to make the life of people easier.

Here you can find some of my experimental applications along with cool stuff that I've found on GitHub.
